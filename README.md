# Remap

Remap is a VSCode extension that takes common functions and puts them within different modes that can be quickly toggled on or off. No more holding down ctrl or moving your hand to the arrow keys! This was mostly started because I wanted to learn how to make a Vscode extension and I wasn't very happy with Vim's keybinds.

## Features

Remap functions similarly to Vscode Vim, but it places functions in positions that actually make sense and groups similar functions together. For example, to move the cursor up and down, you use IJKL, which is much more intuitive that the HJKL of Vim.



## Installation



## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something
